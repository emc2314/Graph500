34 Years of Project Gutenberg


A Trillion eBooks Given Away !!!

If our average eBook has reached only 1% of the world population of
6,451,809,157 that would be 16,621 x 64,518,092 = 1.07 Trillion !!!


July 4, 2005 marks the completion of the 34th year of
Project Gutenberg and the beginning of our 35th year.


Here is a very brief review of our current projects:
[More information available on request]


This past month marked the official beginnings of our
new companion, Project Gutenberg of Europe with eBook
entries expected in over 100 languages.  In the first
month we have seen a total of 100 about eBooks and an
assortment of 65 articles in total, thus representing
62 Eurasian languages and dialects.  Volunteer effort
is totally responsible for these, and your assistance
to PGE would be greatly appreciated in creating eBook
titles from all of the ~120 languages and dialects in
which PGE hope to produce eBooks.

http://pge.rastko.net [Project Gutenberg Europe]
http://dp.rastko.net [Distributed Proofreaders Europe]


The original Distributed Proofreaders have now created
over 7,000 eBooks and you can volunteer to proofread 1
page or 100 pages or 1,000 at:     http://www.pgdp.net


At this moment the initial Project Gutenberg site has
progressed about 2/3 of the way from 10,000 to 20,000
cataloged items in a range of about 45 languages.

http://www.gutenberg.org

By July 4, 2006 this total should be at 20,000 items.


This total includes nearly 500 entries out of Project
Gutenberg of Australia.       http://gutenberg.net.au


104 languages are included with the Project Gutenberg
Consortia Center.             http://www.gutenberg.cc


In addition Project Gutenberg of Canada is beginning,

Project Gutenberg efforts are also starting to get on
track in Portugal and The Philippines.


We would like to take this opportunity to give thanks
to our major download site at ibiblio.org operated at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where
over a million eBooks per month have been downloaded,
month after month, year after year.


A year from now we hope you might be able to download
50,000 items via the combined Project Gutenberg sites.

*


  Not Just Downloads, We Also Hand Out Physical Media


In addition, we are working on The Million Dollar DVD
of which the current prototype contains nearly 26,000
eBooks, and is about 3/4 full.  With those additional
books we can add in the last 1/4, plus compression of
a better variety, we are hoping to put perhaps 40,000
eBooks on one single-sided single-layered DVD that we
can encourage people to copy onto $1 blanks.

Using about 1/3 of the current average hardback price
of ~$75, we can easily count these 40,000 eBooks with
the value as $1,000,000.

Of course, if you wanted to use "list price" then you
could say it was "The Three Million Dollar DVD" {TM}.

In addition, just a week ago we received our test DVD
for our first double-layered version, which would let
us put twice as much on a single disc, and now at the
same price per layer as the previous versions.  These
advances will likely continue until we are able to do
a double-sided double-layered DVD containing 155,000,
which means that you get a million dollar total value
using per book price less than the average paperback,
along with a searchable catalog.


Last week we gave away 10,000,000 eBooks in Alaska to
give a boost to the eBook program of Alaska's Library
Association, the University of Alaska, and many other
participants in our presentations there.

We donated a DVD containing 5,000 eBooks to every one
of the Alaska Library Association member libraries!!!

We are hoping to do such projects in North Dakota and
other far regions, as well as everywhere else we will
be asked.

Just let us know if you are interested.


These are some of the dreams of Project Gutenberg and
we would LOVE to include your goals in our projects.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has
received official non-profit 501(c)(3) status via the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service and is solely supported
by your donations.  Nearly everyone at PG volunteers,
even those few who are on the payroll.

As always, our HUGE thanks to the tens of thousands of
people who have volunteered with Project Gutenberg and
to those who will carry us on into the future.


Michael S. Hart
Started July 4, 1971
Continuing July 4, 2005
2 Months To 1/3 Million eBooks


Urbana, Illinois.  May 4, 2006

1/3 Million eBooks Free from July 4 Through August 4

1/3 of a million books, or 10 times the number found
in the average public library, will be available for
free downloading via the Internet and World Wide Web
beginning July 4, as Project Gutenberg and the World
eBook Library act on their dreams of increased world
literacy and education.

Such a collection, if printed out in standard format
would be large enough to outweigh elephant herds and
to cover the sidelines at all 40 Super Bowl games.

Each year for one month, The World eBook Library and
Project Gutenberg will team up to be major sponsors,
planning to make ONE MILLION eBooks available in the
World eBook Fair of 2009.

"It has been our goal since the dawn of the Internet
to break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy,"
says Michael Hart, who founded the Project Gutenberg
effort by placing the first permanent text online on
July 4, 1971, 35 years ago.  "Our projects are based
on the premise that everyone in the world could have
access to a free worldwide public library," for John
Guagliardo, founder of The World eBook Library, this
event marks the fruition of years of hard labor.

Over 100 languages will be represented for worldwide
readers and that total is expected to increase, even
as the preparations are underway.  The books are the
permanent property of whomever downloads them, but a
warning is including to check your local copyrights,
as the books are provided under U.S. copyright laws,
and other nations have different copyrights.  eBooks
still under U.S. copyright have been donated via the
permission of the copyright holders.

Project Gutenberg, perhaps the oldest Internet site,
and The World eBook Library, perhaps the largest one
of the growing number of eBook libraries, joined for
the purpose of "bringing the most eBooks to the most
people in the world."

"This is the fulfillment of a lifetime of dreams," a
sentiment shared by Greg Newby, as Project Gutenberg
CEO, he hopes his Library & Information Science PhD.
will become the last of the olde library worlde, and
perhaps the first of a new world of library science.

"We can only hope that Google, Yahoo, and the others
can also achieve their goals in the next few years--
as we hope they will each reach for a million eBooks
before the decade ends.  Our own goals, with them or
without them, are to bring the world the 1/3 million
eBooks this year, 1/2 million next year, 3/4 million
in 2008, and to reach a grand total of a one million
volume World eBook Fair on July 4, 2009."

Additional facts and figures:


Proposed World eBook Fair totals for upcoming years:

July 4, 2006, 1/3 Million
July 4, 2007, 1/2 Million
July 4, 2008, 3/4 Million
July 4, 2009, ONE Million

*

By 2009, the terabyte [one thousand gigabytes] boxes
we have seen enter the consumer marketplace in 2006,
now priced as low as $500, will be commonplace on an
average computer on the shelf and will easily hold a
million volumes of a million characters each for the
price of just one semester's books at a university.

*

Project Gutenberg and The World eBook Library are an
example of the 501 (c) (3) corporations that operate
on a non-profit basis to improve the world.

*

Project Gutenberg eBooks are all free of charge from
http://www.gutenberg.org or http://gutenberg.net.au,
the home of Project Gutenberg of Australia, and also
http://pge.rastko.net, Project Gutenberg of Europe.

In addition The World eBook Library sponsors Project
Gutenberg's Consortia Center where entire collection
providers around the world make many eBook libraries
available in their entirety. http://www.gutenberg.cc

The World eBook Library, a member supported service,
offers unrestricted access to its collection of over
250,000 eBooks, documents, and articles.  Individual
membership is only $8.95 a year, discounted to $1 on
a per student or FTE [full time equivalency] for the
various educational groups or institutions.  An even
greater discount is available for public libraries.

For those who cannot afford a membership, or who may
be experiencing hardships, these World eBook Library
services are provided via complimentary subscription
services via Natural Disaster Relief Programs and/or
Economic Hardship Relief Subscriptions.  Not one who
has ever qualified for complimentary subscription of
either of these programs has ever been denied.

The World eBook Fair effort at worldebookfair.com or
via www.gutenberg.org is a cooperative effort by the
World eBook Library Consortia and Project Gutenberg,
representing the largest and oldest eBook libraries.

1/3 of a million eBooks will be made available for a
period from July 4 to August 4 this year in honor of
the date of the first steps taken to make eLibraries
on July 4, 1971, on what was to become the Internet,
via what as to become Project Gutenberg.

This celebration is to promote book awareness and to
assist in efforts to increase literacy and education
all over the world.

We hope you enjoy some of your favorite books in the
editions presented here and that you will pass those
on to others we hope will enjoy them as much as you.

Please feel free to send in requests for books to be
included in future World eBook Fairs.

*

We hope you will see fit to give this press release,
and future similar releases, your consideration, and
that you will see fit to pass them on to others.

If you have any favorite media people, encouragement
to them to use this would be wonderful!


Thank you so much!

TABLE OF CONTENTS

I.    The Roots of the Enmity
II.   An Unhappy Meeting
III.  Middleton's Resolve
IV.   The Election




CHAPTER III

MIDDLETON'S RESOLVE


"I shall go down to Wokingham", said Middleton, "a few days 
before the election, and the Major will stay here. I 
understand that there will be no other candidate, and _I_
shall take the seat.

"The Major is a . . . _flaneur_. He has no interest beyond 
his own advancement. I can buy him for a hundred pounds. 
_Here_ is his answer."

Wallace wondered at the _hubris_ of his friend, and 
examined the note Middleton thrust upon him.

"Sir,
    No consideration would induce me to
change my resolve in this matter, but I am
willing to engage your services as my agent
for a fee of 100 pounds.
                     H. Middleton"



CHAPTER IV

THE ELECTION

  Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;
      Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.
                                    ---- BYRON

On hearing of Middleton's visit, Mr. Wentworth began his 
preparations. Meeting with Thomas Lake and Riley at the 
back of the tap-room of The Bull & Gate--where the landlord
saw to it that they remained undisturbed--he laid out their
plan of campaign.

"That d---l Middleton shall not have the seat," he raved,
"not for Lord H------; no, nor for a hundred Lords! We 
shall see to it that every man's hand is turned against
him when he arrives."

Lake unfolded a paper from his vest-pocket and smoothed it
on the table. "Here are the expenses we should undertake."
