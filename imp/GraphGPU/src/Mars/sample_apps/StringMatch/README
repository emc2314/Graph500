1, Application Overview
-----------------------
String Match (SM): String match is used as exact matching for a string in an input file. Each Map searches one line in the input file to check whether the target string is in the line. For each string it finds, it emits an intermediate pair of the string as the key and the position as the value. No Reduce stage is required.

2, Provided Files
-----------------
MarsUtils.cu: some useful functions
MarsStrLib.cu: an efficient string library on GPU
MarsLib.cu: the GPU MapReduce engine
MarsSort.cu: a GPU version bitonic sort
MarsScan.cu: a GPU version scan
MarsInc.h: included by user defined files

global.h: global include file
main.cu: main function's file
map.cu: user defined map
reduce.cu: user defined reduce
compare.cu: user defined compare

3. Running the Application
--------------------------

Run "make.sh" to build the release version of this application running on the GPU.
Run "make.sh emu=1" to build the emu version of this application running on the CPU.
