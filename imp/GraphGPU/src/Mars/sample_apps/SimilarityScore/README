1, Application Overview
-----------------------
Similarity Score (SS): It is used in web document clustering. The characteristics of a document are represented as a feature vector. Given two document features, a and b , the similarity score between these two documents is defined to be a.b/(|a|.|b|). This appli ation computes the pair-wise similarity score for a set of documents. Each Map computes the similarity score for two documents. It outputs the intermediate pair of the score as the key and the pair of the two document IDs as the value. No Reduce stage is required.

2, Provided Files
