1, Application Overview
-----------------------
Word Count (WC): It counts the number of occurrences for each word in a file. Each Map task processes a portion of the input file and emits intermediate data pairs, each of which consists of a word as the key and a value of 1 for the occurrence. Group is required, and no reduce is needed, because the Mars runtime provides the size of each group, after the Group stage.  

2, Provided Files
-----------------
MarsUtils.cu: some useful functions
MarsStrLib.cu: an efficient string library on GPU
MarsLib.cu: the GPU MapReduce engine
MarsSort.cu: a GPU version bitonic sort
MarsScan.cu: a GPU version scan
MarsInc.h: included by user defined files

global.h: global include file
main.cu: main function's file
map.cu: user defined map
reduce.cu: user defined reduce
compare.cu: user defined compare

3. Running the Application
--------------------------

Run "make.sh" to build the release version of this application running on the GPU.
Run "make.sh emu=1" to build the emu version of this application running on the CPU.

./WordCount <dataFile> 

Note: the test textual file should be in unix format ('\n').
