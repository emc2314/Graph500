1, Application Overview
-----------------------
Matrix Multiplication (MM): Matrix multiplication is widely applicable to analyze the relationship of two documents. Given two matrices M and N, each Map computes multiplication for a row from M and a column from N. It outputs the pair of the row ID and the column ID as the key and the corresponding result as the value. No Reduce stage is required.

2, Provided Files
-----------------
MarsUtils.cu: some useful functions
MarsStrLib.cu: an efficient string library on GPU
MarsLib.cu: the GPU MapReduce engine
MarsSort.cu: a GPU version bitonic sort
MarsScan.cu: a GPU version scan
MarsInc.h: included by user defined files

global.h: user defined include file
main.cu: main function's file
map.cu: user defined map
reduce.cu: user defined reduce
compare.cu: user defined compare

3. Running the Application
